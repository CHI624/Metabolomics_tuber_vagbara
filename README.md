# Metabolomics_tuber_vagbara
- Purpose:
The purpose of this Repository is to allow access to a reusable pipeline that helps calculate Bioinformatics aggregate functions, such as the VIP Score, code for visualization, and transposition, in order to adhere to the Codes format.
- Transposed:
The transposed code is used to reformat tables to fit to the codes standard. An example csv code is posted in the repository as well.
- Combined:
Combined refers to the analysis being done for the VIP Score, it deals with how the code handles the grouping of each component, for combined, if they are under case at different timepoints, they will have their values combined together under one group to find the significance between Case and Control.
- Individual:
The individual refers to the analysis being done for VIP score, but the way the components are dealt with is different; each timepoint is accounted for individually, and the point of the output for this code is to compare the significance between each timepoints, both case and control, and the indidivudal timepoints.
